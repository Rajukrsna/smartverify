## üè° Project Introduction

This project introduces a **secure verification system** for property sellers, allowing them to digitally confirm their consent to sell a property through our platform. The system leverages advanced technologies like **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain** to ensure that the seller's consent is **authentic, verifiable, and tamper-proof**.

Consent is captured through a **video recording and digitally signed**, then securely stored on the blockchain. This provides **immutable proof** that the seller willingly agreed to the transaction. Our AI-powered system also analyzes the video for **signs of coercion or distress**, and if detected, flags the case for **manual verification**.

This transparent process protects both governments and buyers from future **legal disputes**, where sellers might claim they were forced or unaware. All verifications are conducted in **real-time** and **facelessly**, making the process both **secure and efficient**.
